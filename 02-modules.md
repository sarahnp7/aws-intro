# Module 2: Main EC2 Concepts

---

# EC2 Lifecycle

![inline](images/instance_lifecycle.png)


---

# "Stopped" to "running"

* Rounded to an hour for billing (no charges for "stopped")
* A new private IPv4 address unless in VPC or IPv6
* A new public IPv4
* Only EBS instances (more on storage later)
* More [*Differences Between Reboot, Stop, and Terminate*](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html)

---

# Images

![inline](images/architecture_ami_instance.png)

---

# Images

* AMI can convert to/from other image types
* Marketplace
* Can create your own images
* images IDs for the same OS differ from region to region
* AMIs can be backed by EBS or instance store

---

# Images (cont)

* OS, e.g., Amazon Linux
* HVM
* bit, e.g., 64 bit
* Any software?

---

# Root Device: EBS vs. Instance store

* EBS is faster to boot
* More EBS can be added later
* EBS allows to stop and restart
* Persistent ‚ÄîEBS data is saved
* Comparison [Storage for the Root Device](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device)

# Module 3: Environment and App Deploy Automation

---

## SSH-ing into each new machine manually is not optimal... what to do?

---

## User Data

2nd step, advanced settings

---

![fit](images/user-data-ec2-config.png)

---

When you specify user data, note the following:

* User data is treated as opaque data (AWS won't check it, it's up to instance to interpret and execute)
* Executed only at launch
* Limited to 16 KB. (raw data, not base64-encoded)
* User data must be base64-encoded before being submitted to the API. The AWS CLI and the Amazon EC2 web console do encoding for you.  For more information about base64 encoding, see <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648>.
* Must start with `#!/bin/bash` or similar for shell

---

Note: There are many other solutions for environment and app built, test and deploy automation. We will cover some of them in *AWS Intermediate*.

---

## Demo: User Data for Apache httpd and HTML page

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y httpd
service httpd start
echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/index.html
```

---

## Demo: User Data for Apache httpd, PHP and PHP code

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd24 php56 mysql55-server php56-mysqlnd
service httpd start
chkconfig httpd on
groupadd www
usermod -a -G www ec2-user
chown -R root:www /var/www
chmod 2775 /var/www
find /var/www -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} +
find /var/www -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} +
echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php
echo "<?php echo 'Hello World!' ?>" > /var/www/html/index.php
```

---

## Testing Apache httpd, PHP and Hello World

<http://PUBLIC_URL/> or <http://PUBLIC_URL/index.php>
<http://PUBLIC_URL/phpinfo.php>

Note: Never leave phpinfo in production because attackers can use the system info against the system!

---


## Cloud Init

Same Apache httpd, PHP and phpinfo config in User Data but with cloud-init instead of bash:

```
#cloud-config
repo_update: true
repo_upgrade: all

packages:
 - httpd24
 - php56
 - mysql55-server
 - php56-mysqlnd
```

---

## Cloud Init (cont)

Same Apache httpd, PHP and phpinfo config in User Data but with cloud-init instead of bash:


```
runcmd:
 - service httpd start
 - chkconfig httpd on
 - groupadd www
 - [ sh, -c, "usermod -a -G www ec2-user" ]
 - [ sh, -c, "chown -R root:www /var/www" ]
 - chmod 2775 /var/www
 - [ find, /var/www, -type, d, -exec, chmod, 2775, {}, + ]
 - [ find, /var/www, -type, f, -exec, chmod, 0664, {}, + ]
 - [ sh, -c, 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > /var/www/html/phpinfo.php' ]
```

## Demo: User Data for a Node app with pm2 (restart on reboot)

hello-world-server.js:

```js
const port = 3000
require('http')
  .createServer((req, res) => {
    console.log('url:', req.url)
    res.end('hello world')
  })
  .listen(port, (error)=>{
    console.log(`server is running on ${port}`)
  })
```


---

# User Data Bash for Node app with pm2 (Amazon Linux Example)

---

```bash
#!/bin/bash -ex
exec > >(tee /var/log/user-data.log|logger -t user-data -s 2>/dev/console) 2>&1
curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | bash -
yum -y install nodejs
npm i -g pm2@2.4.3
echo "const port = 3000
...
" >> /home/ec2-user/hello-world-server.js
```

---

# How to Restart the app on reboot?

* Crontab @reboot
* /etc/rc.d/rc.local
* chkconfig
* Upstart

---

# Restarting with crontab

```js
...
crontab -l | { cat; \
  echo "@reboot pm2 start /home/ec2-user/hello-world-server.js \
    -i 0 --name \"node-app\""; } \
  | crontab -
sudo reboot
```

---

# Restarting with rc.d/rc.local

```bash
#!/bin/bash
...
sudo sed -i '$i export PATH=$PATH:/.nvm/versions/node/v6.7.0/bin' \
  /home/ec2-user/.bashrc
sudo sed -i '$i . /.nvm/nvm.sh' /etc/rc.d/rc.local
sudo sed -i '$i pm2 start /home/ec2-user/hello-world-server.js -i \
  0 --name \"node-app\"' /etc/rc.d/rc.local
sudo reboot
```

---


Another way to install Node (via nvm):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.1/install.sh | bash
. /.nvm/nvm.sh
sudo sed -i '$i export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"' /home/ec2-user/.bashrc
sudo sed -i '$i [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ' /home/ec2-user/.bashrc
nvm install 6.7
```

---

## Pulling code from S3 (Amazon Linux Example)


```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y aws-cli
cd /home/ec2-user/
aws s3 cp 's3://{my-private-bucket}/{app-folder}/lastest.zip' /var/app \
  --region {bucket_region} # requires IAM role to access S3
# unzip and launch
```

Note: *AWS CLI covered in the AWS Intermediate course*

---

## Pulling code from private GitHub repository (Amazon Linux Example)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
yum install -y git-all
git clone https://username:password@github.com/{username}/{private_repository}.git
```

Note: *You can also use SSH (private key on EC2 and public on GitHub)*

## Module 4: Networking

---

## Problem: EC2 Instances are publicly accessible... but most of the time you don't need them... what to do?

---

# VPC

---

# What is VPC

VPC is a virtual network which is logically isolated from other virtual networks and dedicated to your AWS account.

---


# Benefits of VPC

* Security by controlling traffic to/from
* Application performance
* Bandwidth efficiency
* Keep your private IP for EC2 on restart

---

# What VPC can do

![left 90%](images/vpc-diagram.png)

* Spans all AZ in the region
* Connect to corporate or home networks
* Create subnets which are limited to an AZ

---

# Subnets

---

[.hide-footer]

[.autoscale: true]

![left 95%](images/subnets-diagram.png)

* 1A, 1B, 2A, and 3A are instances in the VPC.
* Subnet 1 is a public subnet (route to the Internet gateway)
* Subnet 2 is a private subnet (no route to the Internet gateway)
* Subnet 3 is a VPN-only subnet (route to a virtual private gateway)
* An Internet gateway enables communication over the Internet
* A virtual private network (VPN) connection enables communication with your corporate network

---


# Interface


An elastic network interface (or network interface or just interface) is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a VPC.[^1] You can associate multiple instances with one interface.

[^1]: <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-eni.html>

---

![inline](images/EC2_ENI_management_network.png)

---

# ELB

---

# Benefits

* Monitors health
* Routes to multiple AZs (fault tolerance)
* Sticky sessions (cookies)
* CloudWatch metrics
* More [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/what-is-load-balancing.html#elb-features)

---


# Classic Load Balancer	vs. Application Load Balancer

Classic Load Balancer ‚Äî registers **instances** with the load balancer.

Application Load Balancer ‚Äî registers the instances as **targets in a target group**, and routes traffic to a target group.

---

# Application Load Balancer over Classic LB

* Cross-zone load balancing always enabled
* Host-based routing and Path-based routing (microservices)
* Route to multiple ports on a single instance (containers)
* HTTP/2 support (security)
* Websockets support
* Load balancer deletion protection

---

# Application LB

![inline](images/component_architecture.png)

---

# LB Scheme

* Internal
* Internet-facing

Note: *Internet-facing and internal load balancers route requests to your instances using private IP addresses. Hence, instances do not need public IP addresses to receive traffic from load balancers.*

---

# How ELB Works: Two Points of Elasticity

1. Client looks up DNS (azat.co) which by CNAME resolves to xxxx.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
1. AWS gives ELB's IP - point 1
1. Client connects to ELB's IP
1. ELB passes traffic to one of the instances - point 2

^It's important to use DNS for your ELB not IP because IP of ELB can change and you want to have 2 points of elasticity. Number 2 is easy to implement while number 1 is harder. https://shlomoswidler.com/2009/07/elastic-in-elastic-load-balancing-elb.html and http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html

---

# Elastic IP

---

# Benefits of EIP

* Static *public* IPv4 (currently no IPv6) for DNS and sending emails (anti-spam)
* Can associate with instance or network interface (many instances)
* The ability to remap the address to another instance in the case of instance failure

---

# EIP

* Limited to 5 per account per region
* When we associate instance with EIP, it loses it's previous public IP (if it had one)
* Elastic IP address remains allocated until it is explicitly released

---

# Elastic IP vs ELB

ELB - more scalable and reliable (no single IP - see 2 points of elasticity); health checks; uses DNS (CNAME record), limited to 20 per region; cross-AZ.


EIP - static IP; uses IP (A record); specific region only, limited to 5 per region; one AZ.

# CloudWatch Use Cases

* Get an alert when your bill exceeds $200/mo
* Shutdown underused machines
* Auto scale (up) machines under heavy load
* Log API calls (CloudTail)
* When EBS exceeds 100Mb through, put threshold

---

# Alerts

* Watch a single metric from 1,068 CloudWatch metrics available in the US West (N. California), as an example
* Send actions to SNS or Auto Scaling
* Periods of 1min, 5min, 15min, etc.
* You can create up to 5000 alarms per region per AWS account.

---

# Alert Types

* ALARM: Data for the metric is outside the threshold
* INSUFFICIENT_DATA: No data or not enough or too early
* OK: Data for the metric is within the threshold
